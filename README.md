# CSE482
In this project we were asked to build a website on Hospital Management System. For that we had to use raw PHP as instructed by our faculty.

The main features that we considered for this website are listed below.
	Advanced Registration System for Patients
	Advanced Login System with federated id for Patient
	Doctor Patient Online Communication
	Online Report Submission

Advanced Registration System:
In this context we only added registration system for patients only as doctor’s login information will automatically added by the developers. Here we considered two kinds of registration. First one is Emergency Registration and another one Normal Patient registration. In Emergency Registration we considered the situation when a third person has to fill patient information and in Normal Patient registration the patient gives all the information.
Here we have used javascript to validate the form inputs in both cases.
